Bubbles (a.k.a. "Bubs") is a bundle of joy. She has quickly adapted to life in a home. Bubs knows better than to take care of her business indoors and learned how to "sit" in only a day or two! She is starting to outgrow her puppy phase, though she does engage in some harmless nipping every once in a while.

Bubs is very adaptable. She may be nervous in a new environment or may whine when in her crate, but these moments are fleeting. She loves playing with other dogs, both large and small. Bubs is always excited to go outside or for a car ride but, at the end of the day, her favorite activity is to cuddle with her human friends. She'll always find a position so that all parties experience ultimate comfort.

Bubs could use a family that continues to give her the structure she needs to thrive in home life while also giving her ample time to play and run around. She would do well with children and/or other dogs, but may be a bit much for cats.
