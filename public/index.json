She has quickly adapted to life in a home. Bubs knows better than to take care of her business indoors and learned how to \u0026ldquo;sit\u0026rdquo; in only a day or two! She is starting to outgrow her puppy phase, though she does engage in some harmless nipping every once in a while.\nBubs is very adaptable. She may be nervous in a new environment or may whine when in her crate, but these moments are fleeting.","date":null,"permalink":"https://jskaza.github.io/safe-with-us/dogs/bubbles/","tags":null,"title":"Bubbles"}]
