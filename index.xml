      <description>Bubbles (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Bubs&amp;rdquo;) is a bundle of joy. She has quickly adapted to life in a home. Bubs knows better than to take care of her business indoors and learned how to &amp;ldquo;sit&amp;rdquo; in only a day or two! She is starting to outgrow her puppy phase, though she does engage in some harmless nipping every once in a while.
Bubs is very adaptable. She may be nervous in a new environment or may whine when in her crate, but these moments are fleeting.</description>
